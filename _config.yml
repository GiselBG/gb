intro: |
  I am a Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.cs.vt.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> from <a href="https://www.vt.edu" target="_blank"> Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University</a>. After 5 years of hard work, I successfully defended my doctoral thesis, <a href="https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/91445/Cedeno_VI_D_2019.pdf" target="_blank">Pipelines for Computational Social Science Experiments and Model Building</a>, on May 2019. My advisors were <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/madhav-marathe"> Madhav V. Marathe</a> and <a href="https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/christopher-kuhlman">Chris J. Kuhlman</a>. I was a Graduate Research Assistant for the Network Dynamics and Simulation Science Laboratory at Virginia Tech.<br/><br/>
  My research interest includes machine learning, data mining, simulations and networked online social science experiments. There has been significant interest in online social science experiments in order to understand behavior at-scale, with finer-grained data collection. My work uncovers interesting insights about social behaviors through data analysis, simulation and modeling.<br/><br/>
  I am an <a href="https://www.fiec.espol.edu.ec/es/cv/cede%C3%B1o-mieles-vanessa-ines">Associate Professor</a> in the <a href="https://www.fiec.espol.edu.ec/ ">School of Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.espol.edu.ec/ ">ESPOL</a>. During the period of May 2010 to July 2014, I worked at ESPOL as one of the Coordinators of the Computer Science Program; from August 2014 I was on leave while I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science.<br/><br/>
  I obtained my Master in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.cs.fsu.edu/">Computer Science Department</a> at <a href="https://www.fsu.edu/">Florida State University</a> in Summer 2010. During my studies at FSU, my advisor was  <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/"> Feifei Li</a> and I was a member of the <a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/dbgroup/dbgroup.php">Database Group at FSU</a>.<br/><br/>

   <strong>Scala</strong>: My current role uses Scala as the primary language and have been building applications in Scala for the last two years. I am familiar with a range of Scala libraries, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/2017/12/an-opinionated-guide-to-building-apis.html"> Akka-Http for building microservices</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/2018/09/generic-programming-with-scala.html"> Shapeless for generic programming</a>, as well as familiar with a range of <a target="_blank" href="https://basementcrowd.com/2018/11/28/scala-the-aux-pattern-path-dependent-types/" >functional programming techniques available</a>.<br/><br/>
   <strong>Java</strong>: I am experienced in a variety of Java APIâ€™s and frameworks. I have worked with Spring 4, Spring Boot, JPA (Hibernate and EclipseLink) in addition to others. <br/><br/>
   <strong>Groovy</strong> I have used Groovy as a language in production for ~4 years and I am familiar with many of the languages features (such as writing <a target='_blank' href="https://dzone.com/articles/functional-programming-groovy">Functional Programming style groovy</a>) and quirks (such as <a target="_blank" href="https://dzone.com/articles/groovy-retrospective-an-addendum-memory-usage-perm">memory leak issues</a>). <br/><br/>
   <strong>Cloud platforms</strong>: I have primarily used AWS for running production apps on the cloud. I have experience setting up, configuring and running applications using a range of AWS offerings, including EC2, RDS, S3, Cogito, <a target="_blank" href="https://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/2018/05/serverless-with-aws-lambda-scala.html">Lambda</a> and its more recent <a target="_blank" href="https://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/2018/10/machine-learning-with-aws-scala.html">Machine Learning capabilities</a>.<br/><br/>
